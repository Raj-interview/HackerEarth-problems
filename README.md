# HackerEarth-problems

This repo contains code for challenges/competitions hosted on HackerEarth. These might include practice competitions and/or competitive challenges. Below each problem, I have listed different concepts/lessons which were learnt during the course of the challenge.

#### I.    IndiaHacks 2017 Machine Learning - Predict the Road Sign : http://bit.ly/2iM1KAm

- Basic structure and approach of an ML problem
   
#### II.   ML Challenge #2 - Funding Kickstarter projects : http://bit.ly/2AU4DGP

- Pre-processing of text features
- CBOW + Naive Bayes/Tree models 

#### III.  Deep Learning Challenge #1 - Identifying grocery product category : http://bit.ly/2iHNlVR

- Deep CNN models with Dropout, Data augmentation
- Using ImageNet pre-trained models (VGG16 etc.)

#### IV.   ML Challenge #4 - Predict Network Attacks : http://bit.ly/2BFx8Fp
